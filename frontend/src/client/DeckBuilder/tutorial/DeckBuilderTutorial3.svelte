  In States of Matter, there are four heroes - one for each class, except for
  <TextComponent color="neutral">neutral</TextComponent>.
  You can only select one Hero per deck. The hero card is always present on the
  game field, cannot attack, has a unique special ability, and the game ends when one of the players heroes drops below 0 health. To play cards from your
  hand, you need to spend mana, which replenishes each turn.

  Left click the card card to select it.
