States of Matter features two distinct currencies: Etheric Crystals and
      Etheric Essence. These currencies can be obtained by leveling up in the
      game. Etheric Crystals are exchangeable and can be utilized to unlock
      chests, fuse shards, or purchase items in the game marketplace. In
      contrast, Etheric Essence is soulbound and can only be spent on crafting
      shards. You may also earn Etheric Essence by disenchanting skins that you
      no longer need.
