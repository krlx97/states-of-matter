In States of Matter, there are three currencies: Etheric Essence, Etheric Crystals, and Etheric Energy. Etheric Essence is soulbound and can be acquired by playing or disenchanting items, allowing you to craft items. Etheric Crystals, obtained through gameplay, can also be used for crafting and can be energized into Etheric Energy. The value of Etheric Energy gradually rises, so the longer you hold it, the more Etheric Crystals you'll receive when you solidify it.
