      In the game, there are three types of items: Avatars, Banners, and Skins, categorized into six rarities:
 Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, and Mythic. Common items are readily accessible, though some may require a specific rank or level to unlock. Opening a chest rewards one entirely random item (excluding Common). Alternatively, players can craft individual items using Etheric Essence and Etheric Crystals at a higher cost, eliminating the RNG aspect from chest unlocks.
