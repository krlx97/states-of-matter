In States of Matter, there exists a wide range of currencies and items
      that players may acquire and rightfully claim as their own. These assets
      are securely stored in your metamask wallet, and it's worth noting that
      you can access them even outside the game. You will earn these possessions
      gradually as you advance through the game and level up, and have the
      option to trade them with other players should you choose to do so.
