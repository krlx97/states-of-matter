      There are three primary types of items in the game: Chests, Shards, and
      Skins. Every ten levels, players are rewarded with a random chest and a
      random shard of a skin from that chest. Unlocking a chest rewards you with
      a random skin from its lists, while fusing three identical shards rewards
      you with a desired skin, eliminating the randomness associated with
      opening chests. Once you own a skin, you can select it in the deck builder
      to modify the appearance of a card. It's worth noting that skins offer no
      gameplay advantages and serve solely as a display of status. Moreover,
      players can disenchant unwanted skins to receive Etheric Essence, which
      can then be used to craft shards for the desired skin.
