<div class="modal__info--tutorial">
  While hero cards are limited to one per deck, there are many minion,
  magic, and trap cards available in States of Matter. You can include up to
  30 cards in a single deck, with a maximum of two copies of any given card.
  Minions can be placed onto the game field to attack other minions or
  heroes, while magic cards have an immediate effect when played. Trap cards
  are hidden until triggered by your opponent's actions.
